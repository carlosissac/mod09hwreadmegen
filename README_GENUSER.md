## Description
*Test 1.* _readmeProto.test.js, writerProto.test.js and licenseProto Unit Tests._
Testing for these 3 modules were implemented using Jest unit testing tool library.
Testing coverage is 100% for all functionality implemented in this module.
Details of testing coverage can be audited by looking into in the following file "./coverage/lcov-report/index.html"

*Test 2.* _fixedProto.js Integration Test._
Module was designed in order to smoke test the implementation of "writerProto.js and readmeProto.js" and to validate the markdown outcome of the readme document.
Validation for this was not done using Jest.
Module can be kicked off setting "select_mode = false" in index.js and subsequently doing a "node.js index.js" or using "node.js fixedProto.js" directly in terminal.
ReadMe file output from this file is located in "./README_GENFIX.md"


*Test 3.* _userProto.js User Acceptance Test._
This module contains the inquirer functionality implemented in order to capture user input. Module was validated by user manually. ReadMe file output from this file is located in "./README_GENUSER.md"


*Test 4.* _index.js. No testing was required for this module._
